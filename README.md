## James Ransome

I am currently learning to code at Makers Academy, being a graduate of Geography and Anthropology, and hitherto a GIS technician and part-time music tutor. In these roles, I have created maps that have underpinned the high-level planning of London’s NHS estate and urban development, and I have thought up and led games and exercises for basic music education workshops aimed at young refugees.

Now I am learning to be a maker of code, because I have always loved to make things that work, and with code, I can make things that work in the virtual universe as well as the real one.

My interest in software development comes from tinkering. Tinkering with Lego, with bits of old wood to create model spaceships, with the program files of my first video games, with piano keyboards and electric guitars. This year, I independently learnt some C# and the Unity 5 engine to create some proto-games, and to have fun with physics.

My ambition now is to build a career in software development, working in a innovative team of problem solvers with whom I can both contribute and learn from.

#### Communication

Having good communication with my team was critical to my role at NHS Healthy Urban Development Unit, where I was one of three people with tasked with maintaining the integrity of the London-wide master estates database. My communication skills were equally critical to delivering effective music education at Soundmix, working with both my fellow workshop tutors and the students themselves.

#### Attention to detail, analytical and organisation skills

I have consistently achieved high academic results in delivering research at undergraduate and masters’ level both individually and in teams under deadline pressures, requiring the construction of arguments based on conjoined analyses of literature and field data. 

I have employed these skills in my career to deliver combined statistical and qualitative analyses at both the NHS Healthy Urban Development Unit, and the political division of the Commonwealth Secretariat.

#### Initiative

I took the opportunity to study abroad in Singapore to explore different cultures and working cultures. This was one of the most gratifying experiences of my life. I have also taught myself C# and Unity 5 with the ambition to create my own strategy games. Whilst abroad I also took the initiative to teach myself to write a program in Visual Basic to mine data from a website over a given period. This data was used for a group research assignment.

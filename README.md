Junior software engineer with a passion for making through coding. Graduate of Makers Academy, with degrees in Geography and Anthropology. Before coding, I created maps underpinning the high-level planning and analysis of London’s demography and health infrastructure, and I devised and led games and exercises for basic music education workshops aimed at young refugees.

My ambition now is to build a career in software development, where I can contribute and learn from the challenge of making things alongside an innovative team of problem solvers.

## Skills

#### Identifying, analysing and solving problems

I love solving problems and have thoroughly enjoyed honing this skill at Makers Academy. Whether working in a team or on my own, my first instincts are to confirm my assumptions and gain visibility on what is happening in my code, then to test my hypotheses. Repeating and tightening this cycle until I have a solution is a strategy that has been integral to my success as a developer.

#### Communication

Working in Agile ways at Makers Academy was paramount to project delivery, where successful coordination of my team depended on my ability to communicate complex concepts, give and receive feedback, and lookout to the wellbeing of the team dynamic.

Good communication with my team was also critical to my role in the NHS Healthy Urban Development Unit, where I was one of three people with tasked with maintaining the integrity of the London-wide master estates database. My communication skills were equally critical to delivering effective music education at Soundmix, working with both my fellow workshop tutors and the students themselves.

#### Attention to detail, analytical and organisation skills

I have consistently achieved high academic results in delivering research at undergraduate and masters’ level both individually and in teams under deadline pressures, requiring the construction of arguments based on conjoined analyses of literature and field data.

I have employed these skills in my career to deliver combined statistical and qualitative analyses at both the NHS Healthy Urban Development Unit, and the political division of the Commonwealth Secretariat.

#### Initiative

I took the opportunity to study abroad in Singapore to explore different cultures and working environments, which was one of the most gratifying experiences of my life. Whilst abroad I also took the initiative to teach myself to write a program in Visual Basic to mine data from a website over a given period which was used for a group research assignment. Later, I began my coding journey in earnest by teaching myself C# and Unity 3D with the ambition to create my own strategy games.
